;;; Commentary:

;; epx is a command runner and manager for project.el in Emacs.
;; ’epx’ stands for ’Emacs Project eXecutor’.

;; Warning! Only works in Unix-like systems for now due to
;; how environment variables are processed. This is temporary.

;; It stores commands in .dir-locals.el or any other dir-locals-file that
;; you set. It allows you to add or remove commands, no editing
;; capabilities for now. You can choose whether to use compilation
;; buffer when you create your command.

;; After the command is created, you can execute it using
;; ’epx-run-command-in-shell’ (You’ll probably want to bind it). Completion
;; for command names is provided. Executing a command happens in a separate
;; window (either ’shell’ or compilation).
